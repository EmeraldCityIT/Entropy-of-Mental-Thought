# Entropy-of-Mental-Synapses
Scientific explanation of entropy of thoughts created in the mind using laws of thermodynamics. Thoughts occur as chemical reactions in the brain which release energy to create electrical signals, heat and the waves which are associated with the impulse of the shock of the reaction. These reactions create resonance frequency in areas in the brain using electrical signals. A theory is being researched which involves physical characteristics of corpus callosum in species, et, all. Looking at species with antennas, and pronounced corpus callosum regions, a study will attempt to show that these impulses in the brain are entropied as a form of communication or signaling between living organisms.
